# Data Structure Used:

- Doubly Linked List:
1. Each node contains three fields: data, prev, and next.
2. The prev pointer allows traversal in the reverse direction, making reverse traversal possible.

# Functions Description

- insert(int val) = Inserts a node at the beginning of the list.
- reverseTraversal() = Traverses the list from last node to first node.
- main() = Demonstrates insertion and reverse traversal.

# Sample Output
  
Reverse Traversal: 30 20 10
